# CampusHub

**Connecting students, fostering collaboration, and streamlining event discovery.** 

## Problem We Solve

Campus life can be a whirlwind of events, hackathons, and opportunities. CampusHub tackles these common pain points for students:

* **Team Formation Frustration:**  Finding the right teammates with complementary skills often turns into a struggle.
* **Information Overload:** Keeping track of relevant events (both within your college and in your surrounding community) is difficult.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Important events are sometimes buried, and scheduling conflicts with exams can lead to missed connections.

## How CampusHub Helps

* **Effortless Teambuilding:** A Tinder-inspired swipe interface makes it fun and efficient to find potential teammates based on skills, interests, and availability.
* **Personalized Event Feed:** Users are presented with events that align with their major, location, and preferences. 
* **Smart Scheduling:** Our calendar integration offers warnings about potential conflicts with exams, preventing missed opportunities.
